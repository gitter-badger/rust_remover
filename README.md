# rust_remover
This is an Discord bot written in Rust.
It is mainly for personal usage.

If you want to use it for some reason go see the installation instructions.

## Installation

### Dependencies
- Rust nightly v1.20 (may work with stable. not tested)  
- All rust build dependencys  
- At least OpenSSL 1.1.0f  

### Linux
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HeapUnderfl0w/rust_remover.git
$ cd rust_remover
$ cargo build
```
To use Cleverbot append the flag `--features "cleverbot"` to the `cargo build` command.  
If cleverbot is enabled, the `CLEVERBOT_TOKEN` enviroment variable is needed.  

### Windows

```batch
> git clone https://github.com/HeapUnderfl0w/rust_remover.git
> cd rust_remover
> cargo build --no-default-features
```
 The `--no-default-features` flag is used to disable the `psutil` crate which failes to build under Windows.
